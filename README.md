# AI_Human_Text_Detector
AI Human Text Detector is an intelligent text classification system that distinguishes between human-written and AI-generated content. As AI language models like ChatGPT, GPT-4, and others become increasingly capable, it becomes difficult to identify whether a piece of text was crafted by a person or synthesized by a machine.  
# 🧠 AI Human Text Detector

**AI Human Text Detector** is a lightweight tool that uses machine learning to determine whether a piece of text was written by a human or generated by an AI. It aims to promote digital transparency and help educators, content reviewers, and researchers verify authorship.
